  <body>
  <p>My name is Nayan Raj Khanal, 20 years, from Dharan. If I had to point out some of my traits, I would say I am very strong-willed, curious, flexible, and optimistic.
     From a very young age, I have been into computer gaming and surfing the web. I was so curious about Google that I would always find myself pondering the logic behind the direct answers
     it provided for all of the queries in an instant. As I grew older, my passion for themes surrounding computers grew stronger. Continuous gaming and surfing piqued my interest in coding,
     designing, editing, assembling, and dissembling hardware. However, out of all those, coding intrigued me the most.<br>
    <br>Once I completed my 10th standard, I came across a crossroad. As my parents are both doctors, I assumed that they would also want me to become a doctor.
     Hence, I had to choose a route between my passion for computers and a path I believed my parents wanted me to follow which was to be a doctor.
     After countless thinking, I ultimately decided to drop my passion and opt for medical and finished my 12th standard. In my first attempt,
     I could not secure MBBS. BDS was not of my interest, so I decided to try for MBBS again next year.
     Unfortunately, we were hit by COVID which stalled me for better as it allowed me to rethink my career choices.
     So, I sat down with my parents and had countless discussions and contemplations. Ultimately, with the help of my supportive parents, I
      decided that it is not too late and realized that it is better to be late than to be sorry. Thus, I decided to go ahead with my passion which led me here to Herald College.
    This college was recommended to me by my friend and upon further researching, the teaching methodology of this college was something
    I found very innovative and unique from what I have been brought up with. Additionally, the extra activities and competitions by joining different committees such as AI,
    Game Development, and so forth were very tempting. I was also drawn by the opportunities that the college provides if one excelled. Also, I found this college the best for this course.<br>
    <br>I want to develop software usable for the standard of big companies and also for the young computer enthusiasts. I also have a desire to work for Game Companies and create games that are jaw-dropping. The goal is far away but not outside my grasp. I am confident that I can get a hold of it with proper guidance and hard work. This gap made me question myself countless times. But now I am confident in my choice, and I want to take a step as soon as possible because, in my opinion, the best way to tackle our doubts is to face them head-on.
