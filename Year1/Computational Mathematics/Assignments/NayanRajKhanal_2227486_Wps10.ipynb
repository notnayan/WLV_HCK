    "A dictionary in Python data structure allows associations between a set of keys and a set of values.  Only one value corresponds to each key.  (In some other programming languages, such a data structure is called a map or hash table).  In mathematical terms, a dictionary defines a function on a set of keys.  In practical terms, a dictionary lets you quickly look up a value (an object, a data record, a text segment) associated with a given key.  In a database of taxpayers, for example, the key may be a taxpayer’s social security number, and his or her record may be the associated value.  In the post code lookup program, the key may be a post code, and the name of the city or town for that post code will be the associated value.  The set of keys is implemented as a hash table.\n",
