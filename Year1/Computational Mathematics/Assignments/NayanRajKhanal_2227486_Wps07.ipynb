    "If you store binary data or send information over a communication line, some errors might occur.  A simple method for detecting errors is based on parity.  Usually the data is divided into relatively short sequences of bits, called codewords or packets.  \n",

    "When a chunk of data is transmitted, the transmitter computes the parity of data and adds one bit (called parity bit), so that the total parity of the packet including the parity bit is even.  Then, if the receiver gets a packet with odd parity, it reports an error.  (The transmitter and receiver may “agree” to use odd parity instead of even parity.)  When parity is used, all data packets usually have the same length.  For example, seven data bits plus one parity bit or 31 data bits plus one parity bit.  \n"

    "It can happen, of course, that two errors occur in the same packet — two bits are flipped from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.  Then the parity of the packet remains unchanged, and the error goes undetected.  The parity method relies on the assumption that the likelihood of two errors in the same packet is really low.  If errors are frequent, then a small number of bits require a parity bit for error checking.  The more reliable a communication channel or a storage system is, the longer the data packets that can be used."

    "If we swap two consecutive bits in a data packet, its parity does not change.  Luckily such transposition errors are very rare when the packet is generated by a computer or another device.  Not so with us humans.  When we type words or numbers, transposition errors are common.  So parity-type error detection does not work well when humans are involved.  For example, when a cashier gives up on the scanner that cannot read the UPC from a crumpled bag of chips, he enters it manually.  The cashier may mistype a digit or transpose two digits.  There must be a mechanism that detects such errors.  Such a mechanism uses checksums and check digits."

    "Driver’s licenses on the island of Azkaban have six digits.  The sixth digit is the check digit: it is calculated as follows: we add up the first five digits, take the resulting sum modulo 10 (the remainder when the sum is divided by 10), and subtract that number from 10.  For example, if the first five digits of a driver’s license are 95873, the check digit is 10 - ((9 + 5 + 8 + 7 + 3) mod 10) = 10 - (32 mod 10) = 10 - 2 = 8.  So 958738 is a valid driver’s license number on Azkaban.  Note that if we add all six digits and take the result modulo 10, we get 0.  Does this system detect all single-digit substitution errors? All transposition errors?\n",
